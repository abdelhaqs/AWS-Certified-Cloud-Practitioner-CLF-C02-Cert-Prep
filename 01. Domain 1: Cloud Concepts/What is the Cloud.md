# What is the Cloud?

The **cloud** is essentially a modern term for the **internet**.  

- The internet is a **global network** of billions of devices (computers, servers, smartphones) connected through physical cables.  
- When you access a website, your request is sent through your **internet service provider (ISP)** to a **server**, which then sends the webpage back to your device in **small packets**.
