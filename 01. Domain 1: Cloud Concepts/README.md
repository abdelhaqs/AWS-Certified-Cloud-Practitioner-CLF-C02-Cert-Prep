# What is the Cloud?

The **cloud** is essentially a modern term for the **internet**.  

- The internet is a **global network** of billions of devices (computers, servers, smartphones) connected through physical cables.  
- When you access a website, your request is sent through your **internet service provider (ISP)** to a **server**, which then sends the webpage back to your device in **small packets**.  

# What is Cloud Computing?

- **Definition**: Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery** of compute, database storage, applications, and other IT resources via the internet.  
- **Accessibility**: Access your data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection.  
- **Cost Flexibility**: Uses a **pay-as-you-go model** â€” you only pay for the resources you use, which can be adjusted as needed.  
- **Convenience**: Facilitates collaboration and provides access to services that were previously costly and complex to manage.  

# A Brief History of the Cloud

- **Mainframe Computing (1950s)**: Central computers (mainframes) were accessed by multiple user devices (dumb terminals).  
- **Virtual Machines (1970s)**: Enabled multiple operating systems to run on a single piece of hardware.  
- **Hypervisor Development**: Software that links multiple hardware resources to act as one, forming the basis of modern cloud computing.  
- **Cloud Computing (Modern Era)**: Utilizes the internet to connect users to large-scale computational resources in data centers.  

# Cloud Computing in Daily Life

- **Everyday Use**: Powers everyday services like email, streaming, and personal account features in **Office 365** and **Google Cloud**.  
- **Scalability**: Adjusts resources like bandwidth based on demand, ensuring efficient service delivery.  
- **Collaboration**: Tools like **Google Drive** enable real-time collaboration and automatic backups.  
- **Cost Efficiency**: Many cloud services offer free tiers with options to upgrade based on needs, allowing flexible and cost-effective usage.
